# mvc-tech-blog

## Description
This application is a CMS-style blog site where users can create posts and comment on other posts. When a user is logged in, they are able to view the dashboard, where they can create and delete posts, as well as edit their posts or comments. This application uses the MVC model, along with mySQL 2, to achieve the login authentication and smooth CRUD operations.

## installation
to install the application, you must run 'git clone' alongside 'npm i' to install it. The user must then create a .env file which includes their MySQL username and password. Once that is completed, the user can run 'npm run seed' and 'npm start' to start the application server.
